# Numerolinguistics

<Insert the setup and some rules.>

Taking inspiration from the [Gresham College](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1t6kKXoBvjdr8m9KJ2Fx7A) lecture [Where do Mathematical Symbols Come From?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edewyp87W-Q&t=3522s) we aim to address the following questions:
  * What's a safe testing threshold for all languages?
  * What's the highest fixed point in any language?
  * What is the longest cycle in any language?
  * Are there any other features of interest?
  * Apply notions of centrality from Network Science.
